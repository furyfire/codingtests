title: Find the maximum sum travelling from the top of the triangle to the base.

desc: |
  By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
  3
  7 4
  2 4 6
  8 5 9 3
  That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
  Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below
  (See file input)

  
solution: Instead of bruteforcing from top to bottom simply add the numbers from the bottom up and let the "highest" number win in a shootout
