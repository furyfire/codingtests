  The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.
  Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.
  (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

solution: We can skip all even numbers since a even number would end in binary 10 - In reverse that would be 01 and we are told to skip leading 0's
