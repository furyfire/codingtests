  Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
  21 22 23 24 25
  20  7  8  9 10
  19  6  1  2 11
  18  5  4  3 12
  17 16 15 14 13
  It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
  What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
  
solution: |
  Step around in the spiral (add 2 - 3 times, then add 4 - 3times, then 6 - times etc)
