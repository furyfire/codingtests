desc: |
  A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
  There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
  Find the product abc.
  
solution: |
  Make a nested forloop for a and b in the range 1-1000 - Then c = 1000-a-b - Test if solution is valid.
